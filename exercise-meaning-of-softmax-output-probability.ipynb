    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with concrete classes and the classification of those, a core concept is the logistic function (binary classification) and the softmax function, if there are more than two classes. Both functions are used in 'simple' logistic / softmax regression (no hidden layers) and are still being used in complex neural networks with dozens of layers, be it a simple *fully connected network*, a *convolutional neural network* or a *recurrent neural network*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a solid understanding of the softmax function is worth a lot. This **pen & paper exercise** is intended to help you build up on this. "
